Feedback from team TreeHouse:
* Could implement a progress feature and badge system 
   * We like this idea and will consider implementing something like a ‘reward system or progression view feature as users go through different plans 
* Think about what makes this website different from other self help websites? 
   * Very customizable format for people to make plans about whatever they want, not limited to just 1 area 
   * Easily search for plans using tags
