FRONTEND TESTING
1. Download NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

2. In your terminal, git clone our repository with the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Jesch101/ThriveToday.git

3. Change to the "frontend" directory under ThriveToday/dev/frontend/

4. Run "npm i" under the frontend directory to install the necessary node packages.

5. Run "npm start" to run the create-react-app start script.

6. The React project should open up to your local host http://localhost:3000/ .

ESSENTIAL STEP:
7. Under the file dev/frontend/axios.js , ensure that the baseURL constant is set to 
"http://143.198.64.92:8000/api", and that the localhost URL is commented out.


BACKEND TESTING 
1. At the moment the backend is being hosted on DigitalOcean in a docker container. In order 
to test/confirm the backend is working, simply follow the instructions to run the frontend and 
go through the website through actions such as: register new account, log in to account, log out, 
and try to log in with an account that doesn't exist.
