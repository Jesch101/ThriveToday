TESTING THE APPLICATION (Option 1)
- To test the application, start two terminal instances and run "npm start" in both the frontend 
and backend directories and navigate through the website that opens under http://localhost:3000/.

TESTING THE APPLICATION (Option 2)
1. Under directory ThriveToday/dev, run "npm i -g concurrently" (make sure to include -g)
    (Note: You may need to run "sudo npm i -g concurrently" if you get a permission denied error on mac or linux)
2. Staying in ThriveToday/dev, run "npm run dev", which will concurrently run the frontend and the backend.

(As of 4/23/23)
-> Test the plan cards at the bottom of the home page. These will link you to pages with a list
of plans with the same tag under them.

-> Test signing up a new user, logging out (click on username in top right corner), and signing in 
with the saved credentials.

-> Test creating a new plan. Either click on "Get Started" button in home page, or click on your username
in the top right of the navbar, then click profile, then click the "Add Plan" button. Both of these actions
will lead you to a create plan form which will redirect you to your newly made plan page. 

**NOTE**
Week 13 new features:
- Popular Plans page
- Users can now edit plans by adding topics and subtopics, and editing or deleting them.
Note: Every time a user adds a new topic or subtopic the page refreshes. This is not a bug.
