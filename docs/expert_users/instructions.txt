(As of 4/23/23)
-> Test the plan cards at the bottom of the home page. These will link you to pages with a list
of plans with the same tag under them.

-> Test signing up a new user, logging out (click on username in top right corner), and signing in 
with the saved credentials.

-> Test creating a new plan. Either click on "Get Started" button in home page, or click on your username
in the top right of the navbar, then click profile, then click the "Add Plan" button. Both of these actions
will lead you to a create plan form which will redirect you to your newly made plan page. 

**NOTE**: Editing plan page info is currently in the works, along with the popular plans page. 
This week's new features/progress is the action of creating a new plan and viewing other plans 
that have been made by other users with ease.
